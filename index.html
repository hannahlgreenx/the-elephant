According to statistics 1 in 6 males become sexual predators, so it makes sense that more sexual education is needed for boys and men on how to not commit acts of sexual assault or harassment if we want to prevent future cases of assault from occurring. It’s a big topic, but we’re here to help.</p>

					<p>Teaching boys at a young age about what consent looks like can be helpful in preventing sexual harassment from happening down the line. The conversation doesn’t have to start with sex, you can begin to talk about consent by showing them ways that they are in control of their bodies. For example, if you are tickling your child and they ask you to stop, stop. You can also reinforce the idea by not forcing them to hug or kiss or be hugged or kissed by people if they do not want to. This will remind them that they are in control of their bodies and that no one has the right to touch them if they do not want them to. Respect your child’s “no” so that they begin to learn that “no means no” and no is a powerful word that should be respected.</p>

					<p>As they grow older, you can teach them more about consent when it comes to dating. Teaching them to not assume they know what their partner wants is a great first step. Remind them to always ask permission and have open communication with their partner whether it’s about holding hands, kissing, or sex. Forcing someone to do something is never okay and doesn’t always have to be physical. It can be shown in trickery, threats, and verbal pressure. Consent is about both parties having equal power and no one feeling pressure.</p>

					<h2 class="sr-only">Talking about consequences</h2>
					<p>Talk to your son about the importance of making good and bad choices, as well as the consequences of these decisions. For example, when they make good decisions, encourage them, and when the make bad decisions don’t allow it to go unnoticed. It is important for them to understand how powerful their choices can be and the long term effects that their decisions can have. </p>

				<p>Remind them how important their choices are, good or bad, and how many choices can have long term effects. When they’re young, you can simply teach them by putting them in time out or taking something they like away for an amount of time in order to teach them right from wrong.  Discussing the legal side of things as they grow might also be beneficial for your child to fully understand how important their decisions are. You can use examples from the news, books, or your personal life to talk about different types of consequences for different types of actions.</p>
